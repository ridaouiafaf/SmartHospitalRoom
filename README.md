This project is forked because it was done in a team.
My part was the linking between hardware and software systems using ESP32. I used HTTP requests and the laptop as a server, the client was the django web app.
The project is a Smart Hospital Room prototype to follow up the environmental indicators such as air quality, temprature, humidity. And to follow up the workers who passed by whether they re doctors or nurses using RFID tags.
